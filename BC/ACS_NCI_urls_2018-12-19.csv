Here is some text: ""A great deal of research has been reported and more is being done to understand possible environmental influences on breast cancer risk. Compounds in the environment that have estrogen-like properties are of special interest. For example, substances found in some plastics, certain cosmetics and personal care products, pesticides, and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) seem to have such properties. In theory, these could affect breast cancer risk. This issue causes a great deal of public concern, but at this time research does not show a clear link between breast cancer risk and exposure to these substances. Studying such effects in humans is hard to do. More research is needed to better define the possible health effects of these substances and others like them. """

https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast,NCI,Yes,"Most of the cancer.gov pages captured manually (added and then sorted by url just to make sure there were no duplicates and only a few). A lot of the research pages that are blogged about are genetics or about promising drugs or pharmaceutical trials (add ""drug"", ""drugs"", ""pharmaceutical"", and ""pharmaceuticals"" to analysis?)- don't think any references to the environment or discussion of research on breast cancer and the environment (despite NCI being a joint funder of BCERP). Many of these pages there is a health professional version as well which I can acknowledge, but just analyzing the one for the general public (a lot of repeating info but can look more into what makes them different) except for the prevention section where I added the health professional pages as well (since these are the pages that more directly relate to risk factors, wanted to encompass both)"
